# TTS_to_MP3-Converter-Android-version-
This program converts writen texts to mp3 
I set the default format to mp3
It uses google TTS engine

I applied androidhelper to make your phone tell(talk) you what to do next(ie. input, when to save, etc)

# This version is for android. 
So for you to run it you will need the following:

1. Qpython for android - You can download this from *Play store
2. After installing the qpython. Open the app and click on the QPIPI
3. then do pip install gTTS. it should install properly.
    after installing the gTTS, go to Editor.
4. Then run the TTS_to_MP3 converter. At this point make sure you data connection is on.
5. When the code have finished executing the mp3 file will be saved at the qpython folder in your file manager, you can copy it to your music folder to enable your phone to recognise it. 
6. If you have reached this point you are good to go.... You can use it to create ringingtone, alarm, reminder etc. have fun.


# This is fun. I used it to automate my phone.
1. I used it to customize my ringing tone like(mister bruno your phone is ringing, please answer the call). So for you to do this         you have to type in what you want it to speak(lyrics) when you run the program.
2. I also use it to make my phone to call my name and remind me of something.
3. I also use it for alarm(that is, my phone will call my name ask tell me to wake up). And much more have fun.
